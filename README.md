# StudentSearchPro
This program lets you search for students within a database.

This is course work that I am building on.



/***
Bugs to fix

-Make prompt input take lower and upper case values

-Make user name transition gradually when hovered instead of drastic switch---I also want user descriptions in the box/avatar

-write code that is able to tell the difference between two users with the same name

-Make box background stand out from body background, maybe with canvas?

-Maybe instead of prompt search make it just a search bar or both

-Make Error alert code for when program cannot find user--for some reason I cannot get this to work. All names return undefined except trish...How come this is happening?

-Need to fix string concat within badName.
